					<p><span class="tab"></span>Sophie and Alex met at Northwestern University in 2010. We aren't exactly sure how or when we were introduced to each other, but our best guess is that Andrew Brugman played a role in it. The real magic started during the summer of 2012 when we bothed worked at the Northwestern Office of Undergraduate Admission. We would give information sessions together, get lunch together, hang out after work. Then on August 10, 2012 we figured out that we both kinda liked each other.</p>

					</div>
					<p><span class="tab"></span>On our first date we made bagels, from scratch! Alex's idea. Our first dinner date was at a Sushi restaurant in Evanston. We like food, in case you were curious. We spent our last year at Northwestern as that inseparable couple. After we graduated, Sophie went to work for Gamma Phi Beta as a Collegiate Leadership Consultant and Alex went to work for a startup software company in Santa Barbara, California. They knew the distance would be tough, but Sophie's job was only a year long and we had an end date in sight.</p>
					<p><span class="tab"></span>After a long year where Sophie traveled to {insert states} and Alex drove to LA so many times...filled with the happiest hello's (the first time seeing each other after a month apart) and the saddest goodbyes (train station :-()...Sophie made the big decision to move out to California and live with Alex.</p>
					<p></span>Now we are getting married and we can't wait to celebrate with you!</p>
