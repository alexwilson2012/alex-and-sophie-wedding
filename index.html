					<p></span>Sophie and Alex met at Northwestern University in 2010. We aren't exactly sure how or when we were introduced to each other, but our best guess is that Andrew Brugman played a role in it. The real magic started during the summer of 2012 when we bothed worked at the Northwestern Office of Undergraduate Admission. We would give information sessions together, get lunch together, hang out after work. Then on August 10, 2012 we figured out that we both kinda liked each other.</p>

							<span class="narr-tiny">The night it all began</span></div>
					</div>
					<p></span>On our first date we made bagels, from scratch! Alex's idea. Our first dinner date was at a Sushi restaurant in Evanston. We like food, in case you were curious. We spent our last year at Northwestern as that inseparable couple. After we graduated, Sophie went to work for Gamma Phi Beta as a Collegiate Leadership Consultant and Alex went to work for a startup software company in Santa Barbara, California. They knew the distance would be tough, but Sophie's job was only a year long and we had an end date in sight.</p>
					<p></span>After a long year where Sophie traveled to more than 26 colleges & universities, and Alex drove to LA so many times...filled with the happiest hello's (the first time seeing each other after a month apart) and the saddest goodbyes (on a train station platform)...Sophie made the big decision to move out to California and live with Alex.</p>
					<p></span>Now we are getting married and we can't wait to celebrate with you!</p>

					<p>When Alex proposed in July 2015 at Twin Lake Village in New London, NH, we knew that this cozy little resort would be the perfect wedding venue. On August 28, 2016, we will be married on the exact spot that Alex proposed!</p>
					<p>Twin Lake Village has been a special place for Sophie since she spent her first summer there when she was just a year old. The resort is situated on 200 acres of hillside woods on the shore of Little Lake Sunapee and is still owned and run by the Kidder family, who have been welcoming guests for 118 years! We love the quaint hotel overlooking the 9-hole golf course and the cozy little cottages located around the sprawling property. </p>
					<p>When you’re not celebrating with us over food and drinks, we hope you’ll enjoy spending time on the lake swimming and boating, playing golf with our friends and family, taking a nature walk in the beautiful wooded area behind the hotel, or reading a book in the colorful rocking chairs on the hotel porch.</p>
					<p> We hope you will enjoy a fun and relaxing getaway in New England with us for our wedding weekend!
